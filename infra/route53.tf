/**
* route53.tf
* ----------------------------
* Purpose:
*   This Terraform file adds a DNS record to an existing Route 53 hosted zone.
*   It links a public domain record (cs601f.ettukube.com) to the EC2 instanceâ€™s
*   public IP address, making it accessible by name instead of by IP.
*
* What it does:
*   - References an existing Route 53 hosted zone using the variable `hosted_zone_id`.
*   - Creates an A record (cs601f.ettukube.com) that points to the EC2 instance.
*   - Uses a short TTL (120 seconds) to allow DNS updates to propagate quickly.
